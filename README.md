# lesson0-Hello
Welcome. Lets talk about the class, teams, and projects.

## Team Formation:
### How big?
Teams should be 2-3 people. Larger teams can only be accommadated if it is clear that the work can be divided out cleanly enough to foster 'sub-teams'. More than 2-3 people on a dedicated task gets messy, and then people get lazy.

### Who?
Choose your teammates carefully. This is likelt the biggest scale team project you will work on during your time here. If your friend is lazy, then don't partner with him. In fact, it might be best to avoid partnering with friends even if they are good! Get a feel for the experience level of your classmates as far as year, previous internships, web dev experience. Also get a feel for how many credits they are taking. You should all be able to put in about the same amount of work per team.

## Project Choosing:
Some projects are new, some need to be finished, some need to be updated. Figure out how much time/passion you have to commit to this class and choose accordingly. If you are a good coder, but have less time and are new to webdev, then consider joining an "update" project. If you have lots of time and want to learn a ton, then try to get invovled with one of the new projects. If you have tons of experience (some of you may know more than me) then talk to me and we can find the best project/team for you.

## What is this class?
This class is exactly what you make it. I took it for two semesters and poured my hear into it. I spend more time on this class than I spent on 381, and I learned a lot more too. This is the class that will get you jobs, experience and general swag in the umich CS community.

## Who am I?
I'm a guy who saw a gap in the CS education here at Michigan and I wanted to see it filled. This class is me being the change I want to see in the world. I'm not the best programmer at umich, and I'm certainly not the best webdev here at umich, but I know quite a bit and have 2 years of full time software dev experience to draw on. I know the issues that you guys will run into, and I know how to teach. Hopefully the combination of these qualifications will lead to a great semester of learning, and the best apps that this class has ever output.
